/**
 * Cefazolin 1 g against 2 g: what the mentor may not do about it.
 *
 * THE SITUATION. `dosing.cefazolin.prophylaxis` grants the mentor the number
 * "2 г" from the international reference guideline. КНФ РК and the Kazakhstan
 * protocol say 1 г. Eight residents trained on that protocol will order 1 г in
 * the first week, and by their own formulary they are right.
 *
 * Under the current architecture the mentor reads the approved rules and speaks
 * in its own words, so nothing about the registry alone stops it "helpfully"
 * correcting a cohort's national formulary. These tests assert the constraints
 * that do: what the mentor is told, what it is not told, and that a number the
 * learner wrote is theirs to keep.
 *
 * Everything here is a prohibition. Nothing in this file approves a dose, and a
 * passing run is not evidence that 1 г or 2 г is the better order.
